# Week 2

## Implementation

- Run the provided code:
	- VGG16 with TT100K dataset.
	
- Train a network for other dataset:

- Implement a new Network:
    - Using an existing PyTorch implementation:
		- ResNet152
		- DenseNet161
		- Inception_v3
    - Writing our own implementation:
		- OscarNet
		
- Boost the performance of your networks:
