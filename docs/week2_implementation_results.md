# Week 2

## Implementation

- Run the provided code:
	- VGG16 with TT100K dataset.
	- Transfer learning to BelgiumTSC dataset.
- Implement Networks:
    - Using an existing PyTorch implementation:
		- ResNet152
		- DenseNet161
		- Inception_v3
    - Writing our own implementation:
		- OscarNet
- Train each network with the following datasets:
	- BelgiumTSC
	- KITTI 
	- TT100K
- Boost the performance of the networks:
	- Tune meta-parameters
	- Data augmentation
